    1.) use module.getEntry() to start at the beginning of the executable
    2.) iterate through each instruction until we find a function call in the format "call program.00401180". This is the "pre-main"
    3.) now we will iterate through every line of the "pre-main" until we find cexit. The call to main is always exactlty 7 bytes
        before the call to cexit, so it is located at the address of cexit - 7
    4.) jump to main and iterate though it making breakpoints at each conditional until we reach a "leave", which means main has ended.
        is at. While iterating through main, check for function calls. After finding a function call, jump to it and set breakpoints
        at each of it's jump statements.
    Note: the term 'jump' sometimes is used to refer to conditional jumps. "jmp" is an unconditional jump, so we won't set breakpoints at it.
    
    Key Assumptions:
       
    the call to main is underneath Immunity's automatic breakpoint
    the opcode string of the call to main is in the format "call proj4.00401180"
        (proj4 is less than 8 characters, all of which are lower case. all spaces are replaced with underscores
    all jump instructions and ONLY jump instructions start with the letter "j". In other words, it has to be x86
          (I can confirm that in x86, all 32 jump instructions start with the letter "j", and only jump instructions start with the letter "j"
    cexit is always called at the end of pre-main. (I use cexit to end my loop that goes through main)
    the call to the program's main is always 7 bytes before the call to cexit in the pre-main
