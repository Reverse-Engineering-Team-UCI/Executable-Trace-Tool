##    1.) use module.getEntry() to start at the beginning of the executable
##    2.) iterate through each instruction until we find a function call in the format "call program.00401180". This is the "pre-main"
##    3.) now we will iterate through every line of the "pre-main" until we find cexit. The call to main is always exactlty 7 bytes
##        before the call to cexit, so it is located at the address of cexit - 7
##    4.) jump to main and iterate though it making breakpoints at each jump until we reach a "leave", which means main has ended.
##        is at.
    
##      Key Assumptions:
##       
##       the call to main is underneath Immunity's automatic breakpoint
##       the opcode string of the call to main is in the format "call proj4.00401180"
##          (proj4 is less than 8 characters, all of which are lower case. all spaces are replaced with underscores
##       all jump instructions and ONLY jump instructions start with the letter "j". In other words, it has to be x86
##          (I can confirm that in x86, all 32 jump instructions start with the letter "j", and only jump instructions start with the letter "j"
##       cexit is always called at the end of pre-main. (I use cexit to end my loop that goes through main)
##       the call to the program's main is always 7 bytes before the call to cexit in the pre-main
